Hashtags are weak. Boshtags are strong.

Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), then [boshtags.user.js](https://raw.github.com/tdwright/BoshTags/master/boshtags.user.js), then bosh.

* Currently only works in streams. Should add support for single-tweet pages.
* Doesn't pick up boshtags at the beginning or end of a tweet.
* ~~Greedy regex is stopping subsequent (single space separated) boshtags.~~ Done as of v1.1
